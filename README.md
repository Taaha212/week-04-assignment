# week-04-assignment
I was able to achieve a gallery that adjusts using media queries so it works well on mobile screens and on large desktops.
I added alt text to all images to make sure the site is accesable.
I was able to make it so that i can switch between images using event handlers based on the users interaction.

For stretch goals i was able to use media queries for multiple different screen sizes and i also added ARIA elements to improve the accessibility.

In terms what i struggled with was to make the background image cover the entire page, however in the end with enough research i was able to get this done.
